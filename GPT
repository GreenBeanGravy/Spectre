Can you create me a Python script that looks at a webcam plugged into the PC and attempts to detect a person in the webcam, if a person is detected, it uses the Mediapipe library to guess the pose of the person detected. It outputs the pose detection to a window that shows the webcam footage, along with webcam FPS in the top left, joints detected as white circles, and connnections between joints as blue lines.

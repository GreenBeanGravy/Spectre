Hello there, everyone. For those of you who don't know me, I have gone by many names. Isuck, ShotgunSpoon, and obviously TheTrueSwampGamer on the forum. I am the person who created the original Fortnite guide, with the help of one of my sighted friends. However, I, with the backing of some people in the community, decided to rewrite said guide completely from the ground up. Lets get started, eh?
h]Fortnite, What is it?/h]
	Fortnite is an online game where you fight to be the last person, or team, alive. Players are put onto an island, after dropping off a rocket powered bus that flies accross the island. You must collect loot and eliminate your enemies, while keeping track of the storm (more on the Storm later). You have many tools at your disposal other than just loot, riding animals as small get away vehicles (or drive by's if you're into that kind of stuff) or hiring NPCs around the map with Gold Bars can give you an unrivaled edge against unsuspecting players. 
h]Gold Bars/h]
Gold Bars can be collected from chests, picked up from eliminated players, from eliminating players marked by accepting bounties from bounty boards, capturing POI's (more on that later), as well as cash registers, opening safes, and breaking certain objects with your pickaxe such as beds. Gold Bars can be spent on the afformentioned NPCs, or vending machines that can give you healing items or weapons and ammo from one catagory at a time (Ex: Vending Machines are randomized every match with a 100% spawn rate. Vending machines will only choose to sell items from one catagory of weapon at a time such as shotguns, in which it will sell two different rarities or types of shotguns and sell you shotgun ammo.)
h]The Gambling Vending Machines/h]
Watch out, though, because some vending machines are not what they seem, they are malfunctioning! They play special distorted sounds that make them very easy to differentiate from normal Vending Machines. Spending gold here will give you a random item of any kind, including healing items, chickens, and Exotic weapons with special abilities, but they only sell a maximum of 10 random items at 100 Gold Bars a pop. The Exotic weapons that it can potentially drop for just 100 Gold Bars usually sell for 600 Gold Bars.
[h]Game Modes[/h]
Fortnite has some core game modes, all of which have some slight differences between each other. Below is a list of those game modes, and the differences between them. 

* Battle Royale: Available in Solos, Duos, Trios, and Squads. Normal Battle Royale contains the building mechanics that Fortnite is known for. 
* Zero Build Battle Royale: Seems self explanatory, but it has a bit more going on other than than just removing the building mechanics. Available in Solos, Duos, Trios, and Squads. Zero Build gives players an extra shield to make up for the lack of deployable cover with an Overshield. The Overshield grants an extra 50 shield, which recharges overtime, Overshield will regenerate around 10 seconds after taking damage unless you are in the Storm, in which case it will start regenerating as soon as you exit the Storm.
* Team Rumble: Two teams of 16 drop out of different Battle Busses on opposing sides of the map. Their goal is to reach a kill objective, starting at 100 kills but decreasing as the match progresses if the kill objective is not met timely. Loot is guarenteed to be Uncommon rarity or better, Glider Redeploy lets you redeploy your glider from any height slightly higher than a normal jump. Players respawn an unlimited number of times until the game ends. The Storm moves twice as fast and has 5 different phases instead of the usual 9. There is no Overshield, and Building is enabled. 
* Creative: This is the Fortnite equivalent of Minecraft's creative mode. Players can create Maps by using some premade templates, the Battle Royale Island itself, or just a large flat area for you to work with. Creative is outside the scope of this guide as we currently don't consider it to be useful enough until Creative 2.0 is released sometime (hopefully, if they don't delay it again) this month.

[h]What do you need to play?/h]
An Epic Games account is required, but you can sign in/sign up using a previously created Google, Facebook, xBox Live, Steam, Nintendo Switch, or Playstation account. This is the easiest way to create an account as it is the least likely to present you with an inaccessible robot test. If you choose to sign in/sign up through one of these methods, a new browser window will be opened prompting you for information. This process must be done through the browser as there are fields you would not be able to fill out with OCR such as your birth date through the Epic Games Launcher. 
This is subject to change, but you will need VoiceAttack [url]https://www.voiceattack.com/filesend.aspx?id=voiceattackinstaller_189_64.exe[/url] and the VoiceAttack profile [url]this is a placeholder for a link as the website originally used to host this file, Keybase, no longer works.[/url]. This profile will be referenced many times as being used in this guide, as it provides useful tools such as the ability to move your mouse around using the NumPad (Faster and more reliable than Windows Mouse Keys) to click on things that OCR won't be able to see, such as icons and unlabeled buttons. Golden Cursor could be useful as well, but we don't have a Golden Cursor file made at this time. Things like this are currently on the to do list for the two of us. The game runs best with a resolution of 1920x1080 and a PC with 7th gen Intel CPU. Intigrated graphics cards are useable, but a low tier NVIDIA graphics card like a GTX 1060 or later will work best. The better your headphones are, the better!

[h]Installing the game[/h]
To start, sign into your Epic games account at [url]https://store.epicgames.com[/url]. After you've signed in, go to [url]https://store.epicgames.com/p/fortnite[/url] and click the "Get" button. Go through the purchase process (the game is free, don't worry), and it will add Fortnite to your library. Now, download the Epic Games Launcher by heading to this link [url]https://store.epicgames.com/download[/url] and installing it like your average program. You will use OCR a lot while using the Epic Games Launcher, and it will be pretty slow. This is the only way to interact with the Epic Games Launcher and to install/update Epic Games on your computer. Make sure the Epic Games Launcher is maximized, use OCR to click Library, and then the install button under Fortnite. Browse for the path you want to install it to, and then just sit back and relax, and grab some popcorn! It is reccommended you have at least 30GB of free storage to install Fortnite.
